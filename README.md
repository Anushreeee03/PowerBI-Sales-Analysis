Title
PowerBI Retail Sales Dashboards

Overview
This project analyzes retail sales with three progressively enhanced Power BI dashboards: a baseline overview (V1), an interactive Version 2 with drill-through, report page tooltips, and dropdown slicers, and a Version 3 that adds a distribution chart for deeper analysis. The dashboards surface KPIs, category/sub-category performance, shipping behavior, and monthly trends across segments and regions.

Dataset
The dataset contains order-level retail transactions with fields such as Order ID, Order Date, Ship Date, Segment, Region, Category, Sub-Category, Ship Mode, and Sales/Orders/Customers measures, covering 2015–2018 sample periods. Visuals are built from a single “train” table with a Calendar table for month sorting.

Tools Used

Power BI Desktop for data modeling, measures, and report authoring.
